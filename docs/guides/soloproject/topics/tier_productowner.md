# Product Owner Tiers

All Product Owners are welcome at Chingu, regardless of whether they have training or a certification. However, participation is regulated to ensure they have the skills needed to guide Voyage teams in a effective manner.
</br></br>

> If you are a Product Owner requiring training or perhaps a refresher we recommend you consider [The Job Hackers](https://www.thejobhackers.org/).

Product Owner duties and responsibilities are the same regardless of what tier they are placed in during a Voyage. For this reason PO's are't asked to choose a tier when submitting a Solo Project.

However, they should meet these requirements, which are the minimum needed to successfully guide a Voyage team.

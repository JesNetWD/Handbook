![Voyage topic banner](../assets/horizontal-paint-splash-green.jpg)

During this 6-week team effort, you'll learn new technical skills, refine the skills you already have worked hard to build, and learn "soft" skills like teamwork, Agile Development, planning, & design. In other words, the skills that will help set you apart from other job candidates.

While Chingu doesn't charge for organizing & managing Voyages, it doesn't mean they are "free". Getting the most out of your Voyage requires dedication and commitment to be an active participant with your teammates and to finish what you start.

- Be an active participant rather than a passive observer.
- Set aside an average of 8-12 hours per week for your Voyage.
- Share your status daily in your Team channel.
- Submit the weekly Voyage Checkin form we‚Äôll provide each week to help us understand not just how you are doing, but how we can improve as well.

We know you can do this and you'll find the impact on your career will be worth the effort.

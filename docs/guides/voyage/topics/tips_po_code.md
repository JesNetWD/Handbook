**Absolutely not!!!** ðŸ˜¾ It's certainly fine if you come to the Product Owner
role with software development experience, but *_it's not required_*.

As a Product Owner your job is to help your team coordinate their efforts
to design, build, test, and deploy your MVP. Keep in mind that everyone on
the team is an *_subject matter expert_* in their role. So, the key to
working in a team is to trust your teammates and to treat them as partners.

When you get in a situations where you feel overwhelmed by complexity,
technology, and/or terminology reach out to your team for help. You may
think this is a sign of weakness, but it's actually a sign of strength and
maturity since it shows you trust your team and you are helping to build
their confidence and experience.

Finally, remember that none of us knows it all and if we ever should learn
it all it's just going to change ðŸ˜Š Relying on your teammates (and them 
relying on you) will reduce stress, conflict, and will help to speed up
everyone's learning.

# My team doesn't have a Product Owner. What should we do‚ùì
![Voyage topic banner](../assets/horizontal-paint-splash-green.jpg)

In a Voyage, we will add a Product Owner to as many teams as we can.
Unfortunately, this depends on *_how many Product Owner's sign up._*

If your team doesn't have a Product Owner, don't worry! Follow the steps that are defined in this Voyage Guide to help you determine what needs to be done, in what order, and how to execute each step.

In past Voyages teams without a Product Owner have used one of these
strategies:

1. Someone on your team can volunteer to be the Product Owner. This works
best if someone on the team has previous experience working on a team with a PO or if they are familiar with Scrum and the Agile Methodology.

2. Team members can rotate the PO responsibilities in each Sprint. This
ensures that everyone gets a chance to learn more about this role.

3. Team members can agree to share the PO responsibilities with one another. This is the least desirable option, since shared responsibility often means it's not done.

Whichever option you choose, remember that teammates should support one
another and you will either succeed together or fail together. Teamwork is
critical to success.

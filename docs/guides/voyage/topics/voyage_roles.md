The primary goal of all team members is to work together in a professional manner to identify, design, develop, and deploy the MVP for their team project. Team members contribute to the project in different ways, each having their own set of responsibilities depending on their role.

All members of the team must commit to following the Agile methodology to develop the team project they've chosen. This involves actively participating in team meetings and discussions, sharing their daily status with the team, and completing the tasks they volunteer to work on in each Sprint.

    <td><strong>Product Owner</strong></td>
    <td>The Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team. Product Owners guide the team through the Voyage using the Agile methodology as their roadmap. They are "servant leaders" who lead through teamwork & motivation.<br/><br/>Specific PO responsibilities include:
    <ul>
    <li>Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal through a Product Roadmap and
    Product Backlog</li>
    <li>Defining, prioritizing, and clearly communicating items the product backlog</li>
    <li>Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood</li>
    <li>Making sure all stakeholders are represented and have a "voice" in the project</li>
    </ul>
    The PO also works closely with the Scrum Master by:
    <ul>
    <li>Participating in Sprint Planning, Review, and Retrospective meetings</li>
    <li>Actively listening to all ideas and concerns from the team</li>
    <li>Quickly resolving any issues or suggestions related to the backlog</li>
    <li>Working closely together to ensure that the needs of all stakeholders,
    including the development team, are met</li>
    </ul>
    PO's should ensure that the backlog is visible to all team members and open to their ideas, suggestions, and revisions. Regardless, of this the PO is accountable for these.<br/><br/>But, it is important that everyone on the team support them with active participation and feedback, and their decisions must be respected. These decisions must be visible the Product Backlog, and shared in the Scrum events.<br/><br/>PO's are individuals, not committees. Teammates wanting to change the Product Backlog must do so through the PO, but they must trust the PO's final decision.</br></br>Because so many of the issues are technical issues, Product Owners who have a strong background in technology, or who are also a developer, are often referred to as a <em>Technical Product Owner (TPO)</em>. You can learn more about this variant of the PO role in the <a href="https://github.com/chingu-voyages/Handbook/blob/main/docs/resources/glossary/glossary.md#glossary">Glossary</a>.
    <h4>PO Role Types</h4>
    Chingu's may assigned as <strong><i>Primary</i></strong> or <strong><i>Shadow</i></strong> Product Owners. The difference is Primary PO's have both the certifications and experience to effectively coordinate teams, while Shadow PO's need to observe an experienced PO before they are ready to be a Primary PO.</br></br>
    Primary PO's can be thought of a mentors for Shadow PO's. They must help answer any questions Shadow PO's must have, explain their role and how they fulfill the PO responsibilities, and assign small tasks to the Shadow (like leading a Sprint Planning session) when they feel they are ready.

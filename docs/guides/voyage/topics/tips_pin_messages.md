![Voyage topic banner](../assets/horizontal-paint-splash-green.jpg)

Every team member in a voyage has the Discord privileges needed to let them “pin” important messages to the channel so they will be easy to find.

Discord does require that to pin a message, you must also have enabled [Two Factor Authentication (2FA)](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219576828-Setting-up-Two-Factor-Authentication) on your personal Discord account.

Firstly, to take care of others, you have to take care of yourself, so:
Start by effectively planning your time. Allocate specific times for each task, taking into account their urgency and importance. This will help you stay on track and avoid distractions.

Next, set clear priorities. Identify the most critical tasks that need your immediate attention and tackle them first. This will ensure that the most important work gets done.

Finally, mitigate distractions. Minimize interruptions and focus on the task at hand. This will allow you to work more efficiently and effectively, but don't forget to take some free time and enjoy yourself. You deserve it!

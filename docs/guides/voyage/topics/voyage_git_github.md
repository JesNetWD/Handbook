Developers and Data Scientists will be using git and GitHub to share the code they create with one another. Although many Chingu's are familiar with using these tools for individual projects, many of our members are unfamiliar with how to use them in a team.

* If you donâ€™t already have a **[GitHub account](https://github.com/)** create one (5 minutes)
* Set up **[Git on your computer & hook it up to GitHub authentication](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)** (10 minutes)

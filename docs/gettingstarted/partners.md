# Our Partners

![Chingu and its Partners](./assets/Chingu_partners.jpg)

Chingu's mission is to help our members transform what they've learned into the experience needed to get jobs. As such, we don't provide extensive training like you would find in school, bootcamps, online training courses, and self-study.

But, sometimes our members need additional training while in Chingu. To help we've partnered with the following organizations to help when you need training:

* [The Job Hackers AgileMBA](https://www.thejobhackers.org/participant/) is a program to help those in Agile roles, Product Owners and Scrum Master, get the training needed to be effective in them.

* [Scrimba Pro Plan](https://v2.scrimba.com/?via=chingu) provides high quality technical training, which guarantees at least a 20% discount to Chingu's.

We encourage you to review and take advantage of this partner training.

# Getting Help

![Web Developers helping each other](./assets/WebDevs_helping_each_other.jpeg)

At some point everyone needs help. Whether it's a technical issue or question, advice that you need, or unfamiliarity with a particular process or procedure the time will come when you'll need  assistance from another Chingu.

We take great pride in helping one another be the best developers we can be. 

There's no shame in asking for help and at Chingu we believe:

- There's no such thing as a "stupid" question
- Mistakes are great learning tools and as such, they are to be celebrated
- No one should be judged for a question they ask

## Where to get Information & Help

### Discord Channels
    
One benefit of our Discord community is it provides Chingus with 
topic-specific channels to ask questions, get help, and seek advice. Take a

## How to Ask a Good Question

Before you post you question remember that getting help starts with asking a good question.

Consider these two questions…

1. My React component isn’t returning what I want. What gives?
2. I have a React component `Locations.jsx`` that should be returning a list of location names based on the text entered through a search component `Search.jsx`, but is instead returning undefined. These are located in the repo https://github.com/jdmedlock/meteorite. Would someone have time to look at this to see if I’ve missed something obvious?

Do you see the difference? The first is just a complaint while the second provides the reader with information and captures their interest.

Good questions have these 5 parts:

1. Its ***actionable*** and contains contextual information the reader needs.
2. It ***states what is wrong*** and what the desired result should be.
3. ***Key elements should be easy to identify***. Like the component names in the example above.
4. It contains a ***link to supporting documentation***. In this case the project repo.
5. It ***ends with the ask***. In other words, what do you need? This information you put into asking a good question is the same detail you should put into issues reports as well!

# Titan - Accessing you Chingu Info

![Developer using a 'bot](./assets/Dev_using_a_bot.jpeg)

Titan is a Discord 'bot that helps Chingus access information about their
status. It also manages the ticketing system Chingus use to report questions
and issues to the Chingu Admin team.

Titan is named after one of Saturns moons, Titan, which also looks green and 
therefor fits with the overall Chingu theme & logo.

## Getting your Chingu Status information

You can access information about your status, including your Solo Project and
most recent Voyage signup using the `/user` command. You may issue this command
in any of our Discord channels, but its output will only be visible to you.

## Using the Chingu Ticketing System

To open a ticket, open the `#support-ticket-channel` and click on the 
`Create Ticket` button. Titan will then open a thread inside the 
`#titan-tickets` channel in the `Incoming tickets` category. Threads will 
contain a unique ticket number and your Discord user name.

Once you've opened a ticket you can then post messages as you would in any
channel. At this point enter your question or a description of the problem
you are experiencing and one of our Administrators will help you find a 
resolution.
